> Interactive implementation of [Arc Consistency Algorithm #3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC-3_algorithm) (a method for solving constraint satisfaction problems).

Solves for CSPs with binary constraints.

## Requirements

- Python 3.5+

## Running

The core program is in `ac3.py`. Run an interactive version (with example inputs) with `python3 ac3_interactive.py` (use the enter key to continue through each step in the algorithm).

## Testing

Run tests with `python *.test.py -v`.
